Six core perspectives of the Cloud Adoption Framework

At the highest level, the AWS Cloud Adoption Framework (AWS CAF)(opens in a new tab) organizes guidance into six areas of focus, called Perspectives. Each Perspective addresses distinct responsibilities. The planning process helps the right people across the organization prepare for the changes ahead.

In general, the Business, People, and Governance Perspectives focus on business capabilities, whereas the Platform, Security, and Operations Perspectives focus on technical capabilities.
